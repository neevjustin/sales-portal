# File: backend/utils.py (DEPRECATED)
# Description: The scoring functions previously in this file are deprecated.
# All scoring is now handled by the scoring_engine.py and persisted in the
# 'scores' table. Leaderboard and dashboard endpoints should query that table.

# This file is intentionally left blank.
# You can remove it or keep it for future utility functions unrelated to scoring.
